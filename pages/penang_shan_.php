Located along Tanjung Tokong, Penang, it is a non-religious and a non-profit, non-governmental organization catering to the needs of orphans, neglected children, dysfunctional families and single parents.</span><br style="padding: 0px; color: rgb(102, 102, 102); font-family: Verdana; font-size: 12px;"><br style="padding: 0px; color: rgb(102, 102, 102); font-family: Verdana; font-size: 12px;"><span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102); font-family: Verdana; font-size: 12px;">The home was built and officially launched on 14th December 2008 by Madam Chan Siew Har. It sits on a land area of 5,000 sq. ft. which was given to the home by the Penang Buddhist Association. The home administrator is Dr. Chandran who with his fellow caregivers look after over 20 children that are aged 7 – 15 years.</span><br style="padding: 0px; color: rgb(102, 102, 102); font-family: Verdana; font-size: 12px;"><br style="padding: 0px; color: rgb(102, 102, 102); font-family: Verdana; font-size: 12px;"><span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102); font-family: Verdana; font-size: 12px;">PSCH’s mission is to maximize the attractive opportunities that are stored in the children; to make something happen; to change the ways that things are and to create something that no one else has ever created before for the children, to explore for opportunities; to provide guidance and course correction; maintaining focus on being consistent and persistent. The home has short and long term objectives. The short term objective is to provide all the children with a safe and supportive environment. The focus will be on the development of physical, mental, emotional, educational, social and recreational skills that will create awareness to structure and mould the child’s future. The longer term development includes the options that are available for the child’s future, supporting them to complete the tertiary education preferably to University level. For those who are unable to complete the basic education, they would be trained in developing their skills by educating them in skill training centers. Through home visits and working with parents, they would like to ensure that eventually the child is reunited with his/her family thus becoming the backbone of the family.</span><br></div></div></div></div>
